css-preprocessor
================

This project is a pre-processor for the source documents the CSSWG produces their specs from.
We write our specs in HTML, but rely on a preprocessor for a lot of niceties, 
like automatically generating a bibliography and table of contents,
or automatically linking terms to their definitions.
Specs also come with a lot of boilerplate repeated on every document,
which we omit from our source document.

A short overview of my preprocessor's features:

* [automatic linking](docs/definitions-autolinks.md) of terms to their definitions based on text, so you can simple write `Use <a>some term</a> to...` and have it automatically link to the `<dfn>some term</dfn>` elsewhere in the document, or in another spec entirely!
* [automatic id generation](docs/markup.md) for headings and definitions, based on their text.
* [textual shortcuts for autolinks](docs/definition-autolinks.md): [[FOO]] for bibliography entries, &lt;&lt;foo>> for grammar productions, 'foo' for property names, and ''foo'' for values.
* [boilerplate generation](docs/boilerplate.md), both wholesale and piecemeal.
* [markdown-style paragraphs](docs/markup.md).
* a [compact syntax](docs/markup.md) for writing property-definition tables.
* [automatic whitespace-prefix stripping](docs/markup.md) from `<pre>` contents, so the contents can be indented properly in your HTML.
* [automatic IDL processing and syntax-checking](docs/idl.md) fro `<pre class=idl>` contents, so you don't have to mark up every single significant term yourself.

Examples of all of the functionality described here can be found by looking at the source of the [CSS Variables source document](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables/Overview.src.html)

Note About Fatal Errors
-----------------------

Bikeshed generates "fatal errors" for lots of things that it wants you to fix,
but generally recovers gracefully from them anyway.
If you're getting a fatal error,
but don't have time to fix it and just need a spec **right now**,
you can force Bikeshed to generate anyway with the `-f` flag, like: `bikeshed -f spec`.

This is also sometimes useful when converting a spec to Bikeshed for the first time,
so you can see all the errors at once and fix them in whatever order is easiest,
rather than having to deal with them one-by-one with no idea when they'll end.
(You may also want to silence the warnings in this case,
to reduce visual noise until you've gotten it at least building successfully.
Use `bikeshed -qf spec`.)

Documentation Sections
----------------------

* [Installing Bikeshed](docs/install.md) - gets you from "reading this page" to "running Bikeshed" in as few steps as possible.
* [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md) - gets you from an empty file to a full spec in no time.
* [Metadata](docs/metadata.md) - describes the format of the required metadata block in your spec.
* [Definitions, Autolinks, and Bibliography](docs/definitions-autolinks.md) - describes how to create definitions, autolinks, and bibliography entries.
* [Markup](docs/markup.md) - describes several of the markup niceties and shortcuts over plain HTML that the processor recognizes.
* [Global Names](docs/global-names.md) - describes the concept and syntax of global names, which are used by several features to uniquely identify and refer to defined terms.
* [IDL](docs/idl.md) - describes Bikeshed's automatic IDL processing.
* [Boilerplate](docs/boilerplate.md) - describes the use and generation of a spec's boilerplate sections. You probably don't need to read this.
